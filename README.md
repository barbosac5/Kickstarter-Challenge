# Kickstarting with Excel-Challenge
Excel Project for Analyzing Kickstarter Data
## Overview
For this assignment, I used a variety of methods to gather data from a large datasheet consisting of thousands of kickstarter campaigns from around the world. 
## Purpose
Gathering data from kickstarters all over the world can help us assist Louise, an rising playwright, who is attempting a crowdfunding campaign for her play _Fever_. She is estimating the budget for her play will be about ten thousand dollars and she is hesistant about jumping in. This will be her first crowdfunding campaign so she requests my assistance in uncovering trends on a large datasheet. This datasheet can assist me in finding patters in order to find out the best conditions for Louise play to be a success. Once these trends are discovered, I can assist Louise by showing her what factors caused the play to be successful so then she can mirror them to have the best possible outcome.
## Analysis and Challenges
In this analysis, I had to look for some factors that made plays successful around the world. Such factors include the goals, the amount pledged, the outcomes of the plays, as well as where the plays were located around the globe. Since the datasheet is very large due to all of the different kickstarters for other feilds such as animation and hardware, I filtered all the campaigns to only show plays in the data sheet. This helped get rid of the majority of data that was not needed for this assignment. I then made a pivot table with the condensed data from the origional datasheet. With this pivot table, I placed Years and the parent category (theater) to the filters section. I then put the months into rows as well as made columns to show the amount of plays that were  successful, failures, and cancelled. After the pivot table was fully set up, I made a line chart that shows the time frame of when plays were successful, failed or canceled. 
In the beginning of making the pivot table, I did have a little bit of trouble makin sure all of the data was in the pivot table. What I did first to make the pivot table was use my cursor to drag and higlight all the data i needed fro. the filtered subcategory. When I selected the entire data sheet using this method, I was able to make a pivot table, but I had an issue where I had some data as "(blank)". This (blank) portion had no data and it drastically changed the look of my graph as well when I decided to make a graph for it. I had a feeling this was not right sice it was difficult to read the chart in the first place. I then looked back at my Kickstarer datasheet and I tried a different method. What I did was Command (since I have a Mac), Shift, and the left kep to getall the data that was there to the left and then did Command, Shift, and the down arrow to get all the data from top to bottom without any blanks from the whole datasheet itself. When I made the pivot tale this time, I saw no (blank) portion. I then made the appropriate changes to the picot table to show the data that was requested from the Module. I then made a graph for the data and it was readble and it resembled what was requested.
